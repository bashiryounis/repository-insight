# RepoInsight

Below is an outline of a roadmap to design your Neo4j graph database for repository analysis. This roadmap is meant to provide a high-level blueprint, which you can later refine with your specific domain details and coding requirements.

---

### 1. Define the Core Entities (Nodes)

- **Project/Repository Node:**  
  - Represents the entire codebase/repository.
  - Properties: repository name, base directory, description, etc.

- **Folder/Directory Nodes:**  
  - Each directory becomes a node.
  - Properties: folder name, absolute/relative path, metadata (e.g., creation date), etc.

- **File Nodes:**  
  - Represents individual files.
  - Properties: file name, path, size, type, last modified, etc.

- **Code/Code Snippet Nodes (Future Phase):**  
  - For finer-grained code analysis, split file content into nodes representing logical segments (functions, classes, blocks).
  - Properties: code segment identifier, summary/description (populated later by the agent), starting line, ending line, etc.

- **Agent/Analysis Nodes (Future Phase):**  
  - To capture results from QA or reporting agents.
  - Properties: analysis type, generated description, quality score, issues flagged, etc.

### 2. Establish Relationships

- **Hierarchy in Repository:**  
  - **`CONTAINS` or `HAS_CHILD` Relationship:**  
    - **Project → Folder/File:** The base node connects directly to folders and files in the root directory.
    - **Folder → Subfolder/File:** Folders will have relationships with their child folders and files.  
    - Example: `(Project)-[:CONTAINS]->(Folder)`, `(Folder)-[:CONTAINS]->(File)`

- **Code Structure (Future Phase):**  
  - **`HAS_CODE` or `PART_OF` Relationship:**  
    - **File → Code Snippet:** Each file can be broken into smaller code nodes.
    - This allows you to map function boundaries, classes, or specific code blocks.

- **Descriptive/Reporting Relationships:**  
  - **`DESCRIBED_BY` or `ANALYZED_BY` Relationship:**  
    - **Node (Folder/File/Code) → Agent/Analysis Node:** Attach agent-generated descriptions or analysis to specific nodes.
    - This can be used to quickly query quality metrics or code patterns later on.

### 3. Roadmap for Phases

#### **Phase 1: Basic Structure**
- **Repository Scan & Data Extraction:**  
  - Use pygit2 to extract the repository structure.
  - Create Project, Folder, and File nodes in Neo4j.
  - Establish the `CONTAINS` relationships according to the directory hierarchy.

- **Graph Population Example:**  
  - Root project node connects to top-level directories and files.
  - Each directory recursively connects to its subdirectories and contained files.

#### **Phase 2: Agent-Enhanced Descriptions**
- **Agent Integration:**  
  - Develop an agent that processes each file and folder to generate descriptive metadata.
  - Update node properties (or create new relationship nodes) with this metadata.

- **Property Enrichment:**  
  - For every Folder/File node, include properties like summary, code patterns, and basic quality metrics.

#### **Phase 3: Detailed Code Analysis**
- **Granular Code Breakdown:**  
  - Split files into smaller units (functions, classes, code blocks) and represent each as a node.
  - Create relationships such as `(File)-[:HAS_CODE]->(CodeSnippet)`.

- **Reporting & Analysis Agents:**  
  - Build specialized agents for reporting, QA, and further analysis.
  - These agents can attach additional nodes or update existing nodes with analysis results (e.g., code smells, complexity scores).

#### **Phase 4: Advanced Query & Reporting Layer**
- **Reporting and Query Mechanisms:**  
  - Develop queries that traverse the graph to answer questions like “Which files have high complexity?” or “What are the patterns in directory structures?”
  - Integrate visualization or dashboards based on these queries for easier analysis.

### 4. Considerations & Best Practices

- **Data Consistency:**  
  - Maintain consistency when updating nodes with agent descriptions. Use clear naming conventions for node labels and relationship types.

- **Scalability:**  
  - Plan for large repositories by considering indexing frequently queried properties (e.g., file paths, project names).

- **Iterative Development:**  
  - Start with the basic hierarchical structure and gradually add layers of analysis.
  - Validate each phase with real repository data to ensure the model supports your intended queries and reporting needs.

- **Query Flexibility:**  
  - Ensure that the graph design allows for flexible querying. For example, a query might need to traverse from a high-level project down to specific code snippets to identify patterns.
